sysmenu-applet
==============

Do you feel that the new "User" menu in Gnome 3 wasn't really
an improvement?  Do you think that the "Classic" desktop should
be a little more Classic, and actually keep the "System" menu
which was there "clasically" instead?  Then this applet is for you.

This is an applet to be used with the gnome-panel of Gnome 3 (as
seen in the "Classic Gnome" session).  It simply emulates the
System menu of Gnome 2, allowing you to place it right next to the
"Custom menu" applet which provides "Applications" and "Places",
thus recreating the style of Gnome 2.
